def seamless_request_handling(view_func):
    """
    Wraps a view to handle AJAX and standard HTTP requests simultaniously. It
    also handles common exceptions thrown from the view.
    
    The decorated view is expected to return a single value or a tuple. 
    
    In case of a tuple, the first argument will be processed for AJAX requests,
    the second for other requests.
    
    For AJAX requests:
     * Always returns a HttpResponse object containing JSON
     * The response always contains a "status" key that is a boolean
     * If the view returns a HttpResponse object and response code is anything
       else than 200, "status" will False and the code stored in "error_message"
       In addition, if the HttpResponse object has a Location header, a "location"
       key will also be added to the response
     * If the view returns something else, it will be serialised in the "data" key
    
    For HTTP requests:
     * Always 
     * If view returns a string, it is assumed to be a URL and a HttpResponseRedirect is returned
     * If the view returns HttpResponseForbidden, the user will be redirected to login page
     * Any other HttpResponse will be passed on
     
    Doctest and decorators aren't friends, so this is tested in the standard test
    script.
    
    When using this decorator with in combination with others, remember to declare
    this decorator first.
