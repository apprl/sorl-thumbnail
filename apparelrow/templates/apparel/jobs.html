                    We are a perfection-oriented company and the only way to accomplish that is through a diverse

                    We are now looking for a frontend developer who wants to take a central role in taking our
                    product to the next level. Design and user experience are extremely important for us and we aim
                    for the top, so you need to have the same passion for creating an outstanding user experience
                    as we do - whether it be redesigning our content-creation tools, analytics dashboard or our
                    e-mail communication.

                    the vision of the company into the user experience. An interesting aspect of the job will be to
                    develop our product for the different markets we are operating in, all the way from the
                    Nordics and the US to Brazil and beyond

                        Needless to say you should master HTML, CSS, Less, Javascript and jQuery.
                        If you are also getting jiggy with frameworks like Bootstrap, Backbone.js or Angular.js
                        on a regular basis it is certainly meriting.

                    experience in our technologies will certainly help: Django, HTML5, Bootstrap, Backbone.js/jQuery.
                    You should be comfortable both front- and back-end but either one could be your focus.

                    branding and business development. Our experienced team will serve as your mentors during the

                    everything works out as planned, the internship can be converted into an employment later in the
                    year.
