            <h4>Senior Web/Python Developer</h4>
            <p>We’re looking for an experienced developer to join our team who wants to build the future of commerce and become a driving force of Apprl. Personality-wise you probably get kicks out of building things that haven’t been built before, are an entrepreneur at heart and are not satisfied until things are perfect.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full stack! Focus is on back-end dev but you should master front-end as well as server deployment.</li>
                <li>Skill is more important than language, but the more familiar you are with Python/Django and our other technologies (PostgreSQL, Apache, SOLR, Redis, Javascript (backbone/jquery)) the better.</li>
                <li>We offer a competitive setup with the ambition of making you a long-term companion and a stakeholder in the company</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let us know why you are the man/woman for the job with your CV on <a target="_blank" href="mailto:jobs@apprl.com">jobs@apprl.com</a> and we’ll take things from there!</p>
