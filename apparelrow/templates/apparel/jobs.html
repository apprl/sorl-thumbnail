            We strongly believe in building things that are larger than the sum of its parts. Both tech- and personalitywise. If you have some passion besides work, tell us! We are a perfection-oriented company and the only way to accomplish that is through a diverse mash of people and experiences. We want you to teach us stuff we didn’t know before, just as much as the other way around.

            <p>We’re looking for the next superstar to join our team in Stockholm, who wants to be a part of building the future of commerce and become a driving force of APPRL.</p>
            <p>As a lead developer of APPRL, you’ll be an important part of our tech team working closely with our CTO Klas. Focus is on backend but experience with frontend &amp; apps are meriting for sure.<br>
            Skill and attitude is more important than language and platform, but the more familiar you are with Python/Django and our other technologies (Gunicorn, Nginx, Redis, Memcached, Scrapy(d), SOLR, Backbone.js/jQuery, PostgreSQL) the better.</p>

            <h5>How to apply</h5>
            <p>Get in touch with <a href="mailto:martin@apprl.com">martin@apprl.com</a>, include your resume, relevant work experience and anything else that you think we should know about.</p>
