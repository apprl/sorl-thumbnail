                    We’re located at Sweden’s new startup hub SUP46 in central Stockholm - ping us on jobs@apprl.com if
                    you want to apply for any of the positions listed below or just swing by for a coffee to get a
                    better idea of what we’re doing!

                    We strongly believe in building things that are larger than the sum of its parts. Both tech- and
                    personalitywise. If you have some passion besides work, tell us! We are a perfection oriented
                    company and the only way to accomplish that is through a diverse mash of people and experiences. We
                    want you to teach us stuff we didn´t know before, just as much as the other way around.

                    We’re currently looking for an experienced developer to join our team who wants to build the future
                    of commerce and become a driving force of Apprl. As a person you probably get kicks out of building
                    things that haven’t been built before, are an entrepreneur at heart and are not satisfied until
                    things are perfect.

                    We’re currently looking for a curious developer to join our team to build the future of commerce and
                    adding a lot of new skills to their toolboxes while doing it. Skill is the most important thing but
                    experience in our technologies will certainly help: Django, HTML5, Bootstrap, Backbone.js/jQuery.
                    You should be comfortable both front- and back-end but either one could be your focus.

                    We’re offering an internship position to join our team as an editorial & community manager for
                    APPRL. The person we’re looking for is probably in love with both fashion, communication & social
                    media and is eager to learn about managing a digital brand and create engagement in social and
                    direct channels.

                    A key part of the internship is for you to expand your toolkit and knowledge in a range of
                    disciplines such as web/social analytics, SEO, e-mail tactics, digital strategy, branding and
                    business development. Our experienced team will serve as your mentors during the internship to
                    improve your skills in those areas.

                    We are open for an internship part- or full time and are flexible when it comes to working out of
                    the office. The most important thing for us is that we find the right person for the job! If
                    everything works out as planned, the internship can be converted into an employment later in the
                    year.
