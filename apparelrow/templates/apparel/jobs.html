                        We are now looking for a frontend developer who wants to take a central role in taking our
                        product to the next level. Design and user experience are extremely important for us and we aim
                        for the top, so you need to have the same passion for creating an outstanding user experience
                        as we do - whether it be redesigning our content-creation tools, analytics dashboard or our
                        e-mail communication.

                        You would be working closely with our designer, our backend team as well as being part of
                        incorporating
                        the vision of the company into the user experience. An interesting aspect of the job will be to
                        develop our product for the different markets we are operating in, all the way from the
                        Nordics and the US to Brazil and beyond

                            Needless to say you should master HTML, CSS, Less, Javascript and jQuery.
                            If you are also getting jiggy with frameworks like Bootstrap, Backbone.js or Angular.js
                            on a regular basis it is certainly meriting.

                            You should be somewhat interested in backend technologies, experience is a plus but not a
                            requirement (our backend is completely written in Python/Django)

                        experience in our technologies will certainly help: Django, HTML5, Bootstrap, Backbone.js/jQuery.
                        You should be comfortable both front- and back-end but either one could be your focus.

                        and is eager to learn about managing a digital brand and create engagement in social and direct
