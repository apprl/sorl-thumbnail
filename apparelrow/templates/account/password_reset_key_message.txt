{% comment %}This template is used to render the e-mail that is sent when user requests a new password 
    Variables:
        - user      The User object
        - domain    The domain the server is on
        - temp_key  The unique key that is identifies this message

Because of Django Templates useless whitespace handling, this comment, and all other tags needs to be on one line

{% endcomment %}{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans with user.username as username  %}Hi {{ username }},

You have requested that we reset and send you the password to your account.

To choose a new password, go to http://{{ domain }}/account/password_reset_key/{{ temp_key }}

Kind Regards,
